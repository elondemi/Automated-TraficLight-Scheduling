# Prishtine Greenwave

## Introduction
Prishtine Greenwave is a web application developed by Elon Demi as part of the Automated Traffic Light Scheduling project, aimed at improving traffic flow in the cities of Prishtina and Fushe Kosova. Professor Kadri Sylejmani served as the project coordinator and lead researcher. The algorithm used in this web application was developed by Atlantik Limani, Uran Lajci, and Elvir Misini, with data manipulation and preparation by Fjolla Gashi. You can find the algorithm implementation [here](https://github.com/atlantiklimani/Traffic-Signaling/tree/ABC_Prishtina_City).
